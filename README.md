# Harbour Locksmith & Security – Static Website

Blue/grey, tradesman-feel website with **Home, Services, About, Contact, Gallery**.
Built to be **fast, accessible, and deployable on Netlify**.

## Quick start
1. Upload the folder to a new GitHub repo.
2. On Netlify: **New site → Import from GitHub** and select the repo.
3. Set your custom domain (e.g. `harbourlocks.co.uk`) and Netlify will issue SSL automatically.

## Netlify Forms
The contact form is set up with `data-netlify="true"`. Submissions will appear in your Netlify dashboard.

## Update branding
- Replace `assets/logo.svg` with your logo (same filename).
- Edit phone number and areas in each page.
- Colours live in `assets/styles.css` under `:root`.

## Pages
